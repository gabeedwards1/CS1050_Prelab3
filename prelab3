/*For the prelab assignment, you are to write a program that goes through all integers from 1 through 50
in order from the least value (1) through the greatest value (50). As you move through these integers, if
the current integer is divisible by 3, print “Fizz”. If the current integer is divisible by 5, print “Buzz”. If
the current integer is divisible by both 5 and 3, print “Fizz Buzz”. If the current integer is divisible by
neither 5 nor 3, print the integer. You should print a comma after each thing you print (whether “Fizz”,
“Buzz”, “Fizz Buzz”, or a number), except for the last one. If you have trouble doing all but the last one,
it is OK to print a comma after the last one too, but....cooler if you don’t*/
